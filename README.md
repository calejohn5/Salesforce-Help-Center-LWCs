Reusable bundle of LWCs for any experience cloud site. This is admin friendly as it allows them to customize the text font, color, size, and image without code. Simply navigate to the articles records and update the settings there.





Mobile Friendly
This LWC has adaptive versions to render differently when viewed from a mobile device. This is done via the Form Factor that is identified in the Javascript. The Form Factor will be set to ‘Small” when viewed on a mobile device, and that is what is used in the LWC to change the styling. Additionally it can be set as ‘Large’ and 'Medium’ for desktops and tablets, but currently we only differentiate mobile.
@media is also used in the CSS for the helpCenterTopicCategories lwc. This is another way to style depending on what’s being used to view the webpage. Below are images of the mobile version.
